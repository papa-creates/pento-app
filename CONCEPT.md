## "Put Pen To Paper" — A Writing App for Procrastinators

## THE CONCEPT

You're staring at a blank page. Again. The cursor blinks. Mocking you.

Enter your **Writing Buddies** — three legendary authors who've been summoned from the great beyond to kick your ass into gear. They don't care about your excuses. They've written masterpieces while drunk, broke, heartbroken, and hunted by the FBI.

Pick your buddy. Get your prompt. Write.

- "500 words. No excuses. The fish aren't going anywhere."

**Prompt Style:**
